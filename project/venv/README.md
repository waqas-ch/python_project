# School-Management-System
My Python 2.7 GUI based Project
This is basically a Python GUI program which is capable of storing, editing school student database.
In this project, we can register/view student details, their fee information including fee due and fee paid. Then also we can upload/view student attendance according to their respective roll numbers. Then also we can upload/view marks of students in various subjects accordingly.
Further, there is a school gallery which includes pictures related to school.
And there are two modes of working in this project that is either student mode or faculty mode.
In student mode, there are several restrictions on some of the features like register attendance, makes, details, etc.
In student mode, a person has access to only view their respective information.
Whereas in Faculty Mode, restrictions are removed since faculty can have access to all the features of the project.
There are further security features according to which there are some user name and password by using which only the authorized person can only access the information.
Moreover, by the help of Pandas library in python, I am storing all the necessary data like student details, student attendance, student marks which in Excel Sheets which are present at the same folder of the project.
Additional features include:
Splash screen, pop-up messages that arrive at several places providing the necessary information, any many more.
Requirements:
Python 2.7, Pandas Package,xlsxwriter package.
